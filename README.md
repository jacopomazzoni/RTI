# RTI Dome Controller Firmware

![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/jacopomazzoni/RTI)

## Overview

This Arduino project provides firmware for an RTI (Reflection Transformation Images) Dome Controller that utilizes addressable RGBW LED strips and controls a timer for a camera.

## Features

- **Addressable RGBW LED Support:** Illuminate your dome using addressable RGBW LED strips.
- **Camera Timer Control:** Precisely control the timing of your camera and see an estimate of the capture time.
- **Simple Codebase:** Easily customize the behavior of the dome controller to suit your specific requirements.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The firmware is designed with a user-friendly interface to simplify setup and operation.

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino Board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Addressable RGBW LED Strips
- Camera with Remote shutter Capability
- [5v Relay switch]
- 16x4 LCD display with ic2 controller
- 2 rotary encoders
- 1 latching switch
- 1 semispherical plastic bowl

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jacopomazzoni/RTI.git
    ```

2. Upload the firmware to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE or your preferred method.

3. build the device (schematics coming soon)
